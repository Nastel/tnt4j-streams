AMQ9788: Slow DNS lookup for address '172.16.6.47'.

EXPLANATION:
An attempt to resolve address '172.16.6.47' using the 'getnameinfo' function
call took 12 seconds to complete. This might indicate a problem with the DNS
configuration.
ACTION:
Ensure that DNS is correctly configured on the local system. 

If the address was an IP address then the slow operation was a reverse DNS
lookup. Some DNS configurations are not capable of reverse DNS lookups and some
IP addresses have no valid reverse DNS entries. If the problem persists,
consider disabling reverse DNS lookups until the issue with the DNS can be
resolved.

EXPLANATION:
The channel program running under process ID 6796(5600) for channel
'SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN' ended abnormally. The host name is '172.16.6.47'; in some
cases the host name cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Look at previous error messages for the channel program in the error logs to
determine the cause of the failure. Note that this message can be excluded
completely or suppressed by tuning the "ExcludeMessage" or "SuppressMessage"
attributes under the "QMErrorLog" stanza in qm.ini. Further information can be

'T1' and may have been defined in the channel definition, or supplied either by
a channel exit or by a client.
ACTION:
Ensure that the user ID is correct and that it is defined on the Windows local
system, the local domain or on a trusted domain. For a domain user ID, ensure
that all necessary domain controllers are available.

'T1' and may have been defined in the channel definition, or supplied either by
a channel exit or by a client.
